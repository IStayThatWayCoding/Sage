    rules: [
        `Be respectful. Do not argue with, harass or bully any member of the discord. Any form of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc. (including derogatory terms) will get you punished.`,
        `Obey all staff members. Do not argue with staff - their decisions are final. If someone is breaking the rules, __ping a staff member or admin in the channel or dm a mod instead of mini-modding.__ Refrain from troll/unnecessary pinging of staff.`,
        `Swearing is allowed, but please do not use such language excessively towards another user, this is a safe space.`,
        `Do **__NOT__** post any inappropriate/NSFW content. This includes videos, images, links, emojis, profile pictures, usernames/nicknames, and discussion of overly-sexual content. Be mindful that there are younger members of the discord and that certain conversations may make people uncomfortable.`,
        `Do not dox or post any irl personal information about anyone, or post any unsafe links such as IP grabbers or scams. **(Doing so will get you immediately banned from the server.)**`,
        `Do not spam in channels and don't spam/mass ping people unnecessarily, especially other creators. **Do not ping Oasis (Swiftblade)** for any reason either (this also includes trying to @/everyone and spam reacting).`,
        `Use the text channels in their correct use. For example, only use bot commands in <#903523421042929674>`,
        `Do not discuss topics that tend to make people uncomfortable. This includes topics such as self-harm, intense political discussions and beliefs that would offend people, and extreme over-sexualization of individuals. This also applies to cheats/hack client naming for Minecraft, and other illegal practices such as account trading, etc.`,
        `Do not be disruptive in voice channels. This includes spam hopping channels, being excessively loud/annoying, and playing soundboards.`,
        `Use common sense! (Do not advertise/self promote, try and find loopholes, joke about being under 13, purposely confusing/upsetting others, etc.)`,
        `Ban evasion and mute evasion are **__not allowed.__** If you are caught doing this, your main account's punishment will be extended.`,
        `Do not discuss or ask about other members' punishments, and don't ping or make fun of those that are muted (other peopleâ€™s bans, mutes, etc.)`,
        `Please make sure you follow the Discord TOS and Community Guidelines. Failure to comply to these terms may get your account terminated!`
